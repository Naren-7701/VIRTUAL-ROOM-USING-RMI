# VIRTUAL-ROOM-USING-RMI
A Distributed Chat based Application using JAVA RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
1. The Server is started in the Terminal which will run in the Background.
2. The client tries to connect the Virtual room and sends a request to the server to join the Virtual room.
3. The Client has Three Main areas in the Chat Window (Chat Area, Text Entry Area, and Client Panel).
4. The server assigns the client to the room and sends a list of all the other users in the room to the Client.
5. The Client Panel displays the list of users, and the user can chat with other users by sending / receiving messages.
6. The Client can send a message to a Specific user (or) Unicast (or) Broadcast.
7. Once the message is sent by the Client, the Receiver will get the Message.
8. This process continues as long as the user stays in the Virtual room, allowing them to have a real-time conversation.
